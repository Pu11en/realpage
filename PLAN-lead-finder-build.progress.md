# Progress log: PLAN-lead-finder-build

## 1.1 Skeleton + check + no-place-names test -- done

- Created `propertystack/skills/lead-finder/` with `SKILL.md` (describes all 6 parts,
  area-agnostic rule, caps) and a `run.py` stub (`--state`, `--run-id` args, not yet wired).
- Added `propertystack/skills/lead-finder/tests/test_no_place_names.py`: scans every
  `propertystack/skills/lead-finder*/**/*.py` (excluding fixtures and the test file itself)
  for literal US state names and a list of big cities/counties (including Plano, Richardson,
  Collin, Dallas); fails the check if any show up. Data files (csv/json) are exempt by design
  -- only code is scanned.
- Added `tooling/qa/check-lead-finder.sh`: runs pytest on every `lead-finder*/tests` dir plus
  `tooling/qa/check-panel.sh`, matching the pattern used by `check-client-map.sh`.
- Deleted the 4 old Plano-only skills: `propertystack/skills/{find-apartments,find-sales,
  build-table,scout-areas}` (code only -- checked first that nothing else in the repo imports
  their code; their historical run JSON files under `propertystack/runs/` and the Dallas data
  in `propertystack/data/dallas-parked/` were left alone since `site/data/build_data.py` reads
  those run files by skill name, not the skill code).
- Checked: `bash tooling/qa/check-lead-finder.sh` passes (2 tests + panel check clean).
  Also ran `python3 site/data/build_data.py` directly to confirm the site still builds after
  the deletions -- it does (properties, leads, pipeline, client-map all wrote fine).
- Nothing left open for this task. Next task (1.2) adds the actual lead record format and
  `docs/LEAD-FORMAT.md`.
